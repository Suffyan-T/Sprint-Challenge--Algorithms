#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) => because n is increasing linearly with a single step.


b) O(n)  => Even though there is a second loop it is a comparison not an iteration


c) O(1) => Even though this is recursive you are still only returning a constant

## Exercise II
Best way to solve this is thrugh Binary Search O(log n).

Travel to mid floor
    if breaks, travel to mid point between floor and  current floor
        repeat
    if doesn't break, travel to mid point between current floor and max floor
        repeat
